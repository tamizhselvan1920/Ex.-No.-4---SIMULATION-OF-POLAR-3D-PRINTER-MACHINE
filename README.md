## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Polar 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Polar 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Polar 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
### 1.	Move the r-axis slider and observe the movement of the r-axis assembly.
### 2.	Move the y-axis slider and observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
### 3.	Move the z-axis slider and observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

## OUTPUT:




#### Y-Axis Base:
The Y-axis base is the foundational component of the printer's Y-axis assembly. It serves as the mounting platform for other Y-axis components, such as smooth rods, bearings, motors, and the print bed. The Y-axis base provides stability and support to ensure accurate movement along the Y-axis.

 #### Z-Axis Frame:
The Z-axis frame is the structural framework that supports and houses the components involved in the Z-axis assembly. It typically includes the smooth rods, linear bearings, threaded rods, and the print head or extruder assembly. The Z-axis frame ensures stability and proper alignment for vertical movement.

#### Smooth Rods:
Smooth rods are cylindrical bars with a smooth and polished surface. In the context of a Polar 3D printer assembly, smooth rods are used as guides for linear motion. They provide a low-friction surface for the print bed or extruder assembly to move smoothly along the designated axes.

#### Motors:
Motors in a Polar 3D printer assembly are electrical devices that convert electrical energy into mechanical motion. They are typically stepper motors used to drive the movement of various printer components, such as the print bed, extruder assembly, or Z-axis mechanism. Motors play a crucial role in achieving precise and controlled movements during the printing process.

#### Extruder Supporter:
The extruder supporter refers to a component in the printer assembly that provides support and stability to the extruder assembly. It is typically a structural element or bracket that holds the extruder securely in place, ensuring proper alignment and movement during the printing process.

#### Threaded Rod:
A threaded rod is a cylindrical rod with a helical thread pattern along its length. In a Polar 3D printer assembly, threaded rods are commonly used in the Z-axis mechanism. They are rotated by the motor to raise or lower the print head or print bed along the Z-axis.

#### Y-Axis Frame:
The Y-axis frame is a structural framework that supports the Y-axis assembly components, such as smooth rods, bearings, and the print bed. It provides rigidity and stability, ensuring accurate and controlled movement along the Y-axis.

#### Motor with Gear:
A motor with gear refers to a stepper motor coupled with a gear mechanism. It is used to transmit rotational motion from the motor to other components in the printer assembly. The gear mechanism helps to increase torque or change the speed of the motor's output.

#### Motor-with-Pulley:
Similar to the motor with gear, a motor with a pulley combines a stepper motor with a pulley mechanism. The motor rotates the pulley, which is connected to a belt or cable, enabling precise movement of components such as the print head or print bed.

#### Gears:
Gears are toothed mechanical components used to transmit and control rotational motion between two shafts. In the context of a Polar 3D printer assembly, gears may be used in the motor system or other mechanisms to control movement and achieve proper gear ratios.

### Plate:
In a Polar 3D printer assembly, a plate refers to a flat and rigid component that serves as a structural element or mounting platform for various printer components. It provides stability, alignment, and support for the assembly.

#### Extruder: 
The extruder is a critical component in a Polar 3D printer assembly. It is responsible for feeding filament material, typically plastic, into the hot end or nozzle. The extruder consists of a motor, filament drive mechanism (such as a gear or wheel), and a heating element. It controls the precise deposition of molten filament to create the 3D printed object.

#### Filament:
 Filament is the material used in 3D printing, usually in the form of a long, thin strand. In a Polar 3D printer assembly, filament is typically made of plastic and is fed into the extruder. The extruder heats and melts the filament, allowing it to be deposited layer by layer to create the final 3D printed object.

## Output:





### Name: THAMIZH SELVAN.R
### Register Number:212222230158

## Result: 
### Thus the simulation on construction of polar 3D printer is completed & movement of axis along X, Y, & Z has been studied.
